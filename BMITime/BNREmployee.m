#import "BNRAsset.h"    //To process this program the compiler needs to know a lot about the BNRAsset class.
                        // Reason why I have imported BNRAsset.h instead of using @class


// A Class extension - a set of declarations that is private. Only the class or instances of the class are able to use the properties, instance variables, or methods
//                     declared in a class extension.
/* Moving the office AlarmCode declaration from the BNREmployee.h file to a class extension here has two related effects:
 * 1). Objects that are not instance of BNREmployee can no longer see this property. Exmaple, a non-BNREmployee object could attempt to access an 
 * employee's alarm code like this:
 *      BNREmployee *mikey = [[BNREmployee alloc] init];
 *      unsigned int mikeysCode = mikey.officeAlarmCode;
 *  which results in a compiler error that reads "No visible @interface declares the instance method officeAlarmCode". The only interface that is visible
 * to a non-BNREmployee object is the BNREmployee header.
 *
 * 2). The BNREmployee header has one less declaration and thus a little bit simpler. This is a good thing. The header is intended to be a billboard;
 *     its job is to advertise what other developers need to know to make our class work in the code that they write. Too much information makes a header
 *     difficult for other developer to read and use.
